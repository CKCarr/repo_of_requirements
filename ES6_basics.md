# For Node.js, Jest, Babel, ESlint -- versions may be outdated- check requirements:)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<INFORMATION>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
### 1. Jest:
Jest is a popular JavaScript testing framework often used for unit testing and integration testing in JavaScript
projects. It provides a robust and easy-to-use testing environment, including features like test runners, assertion
libraries, and mocking capabilities. 
By installing Jest as a development dependency, you can write and run tests for your JavaScript code.

### 2. Babel:
Babel is a JavaScript compiler that allows you to write modern JavaScript code (ES6+ and beyond)
and then transpile it into older versions of JavaScript (typically ES5) that can run in older browsers or environments.
In the context of Jest, you're installing babel-jest, which is a Jest plugin that integrates Babel with Jest.
It enables Jest to understand and process modern JavaScript syntax during testing.
        @babel/core: The core package of Babel.
        @babel/preset-env: A Babel preset that allows you to target specific JavaScript environments,
        so you can transpile your code to match the capabilities of your target runtime environment.

### 3. ESLint:
ESLint is a static code analysis tool for identifying and fixing problems in JavaScript code. It helps enforce coding
standards, detect potential bugs, and ensure code consistency across your project. By installing ESLint as a
development dependency, you can configure and run linting checks on your JavaScript code to maintain code quality and
style.

These tools are commonly used in JavaScript development to ensure code quality, maintainability, and reliability.
Jest is for testing your code,
Babel is for transpiling modern JavaScript,
and ESLint is for code linting and style checking.

**********************************
## Step 1: Install Node.js 12.11.x
**********************************
In your home directory, open a terminal and run the following commands:
for sandbox this is user directory `~`

```
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_12.x -o nodesource_setup.sh
sudo bash nodesource_setup.sh
sudo apt install nodejs -y
```
Verify the Node.js and npm versions:

```
nodejs -v
npm -v
```
***************************************
## Step 2: Set up your project directory
***************************************
<p>Navigate to your project directory using the terminal.</p>



****************************************
## Step 3: Install Jest, Babel, and ESLint
****************************************
<p>Run the following commands to install Jest, Babel, and ESLint as dev dependencies:<br>
 You can install them globally on your system if you intend to use the same versions of these tools across multiple projects.
However, it's a good practice to install them as project-specific dependencies in each project's directory.</p>

```
npm install --save-dev jest
npm install --save-dev babel-jest @babel/core @babel/preset-env
npm install --save-dev eslint

```
<p>The package-lock.json file is an automatically generated file by npm after these are installed.<br>
package-lock.json is automatically generated by npm to lock down the specific versions of dependencies used in your project.<br>
It's meant to be machine-generated and typically not edited by developers.<br>
It can be useful for debugging or ensuring reproducible builds.</p>

*****************************************
 ## Step 4: Create Configuration Files
*****************************************
<p>You should create these configuration files in your project directory.</p>

<<--  <h4>package.json:</h4> -->>
You may already have this file. It's used to manage your project's dependencies.
If it's not there, you can create one using ``npm init`` and follow the prompts. 
<p>package.json is manually created and edited by developers to define project metadata, dependencies, and scripts.</p>-->>

```
{
  "scripts": {
    "lint": "./node_modules/.bin/eslint",
    "check-lint": "lint [0-9]*.js",
    "dev": "npx babel-node",
    "test": "jest",
    "full-test": "./node_modules/.bin/eslint [0-9]*.js && jest"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@babel/core": "^7.6.0",
    "@babel/node": "^7.8.0",
    "@babel/preset-env": "^7.6.0",
    "eslint": "^6.4.0",
    "eslint-config-airbnb-base": "^14.0.0",
    "eslint-plugin-import": "^2.18.2",
    "eslint-plugin-jest": "^22.17.0",
    "jest": "^24.9.0"
  }
}
```

<<-- <h4>BABEL: babel.config.js</h4> -->>
file in your project directory if it doesn't exist and configure it according to your project's requirements. -->>

```
module.exports = {
  presets: [
    [
      '@babel/preset-env',
      {
        targets: {
          node: 'current',
        },
      },
    ],
  ],
};
```

<<--  <h4>ESLINT: .eslintrc.js</h4> -->
 file in your project directory if it doesn't exist and configure it according to your project's ESLint rules. -->>

```
module.exports = {
  env: {
    browser: false,
    es6: true,
    jest: true,
  },
  extends: [
    'airbnb-base',
    'plugin:jest/all',
  ],
  globals: {
    Atomics: 'readonly',
    SharedArrayBuffer: 'readonly',
  },
  parserOptions: {
    ecmaVersion: 2018,
    sourceType: 'module',
  },
  plugins: ['jest'],
  rules: {
    'no-console': 'off',
    'no-shadow': 'off',
    'no-restricted-syntax': [
      'error',
      'LabeledStatement',
      'WithStatement',
    ],
  },
  overrides:[
    {
      files: ['*.js'],
      excludedFiles: 'babel.config.js',
    }
  ]
};
```

*******************************************
Step 5: Install Project Dependencies
*******************************************
Run the following command in your project directory to install all necessary project dependencies based on the package.json file:

```
npm install

```
<p>By running npm install again after creating the configuration files, you ensure that your package-lock.json file accurately reflects the state of your project's dependencies, and it's synchronized with your package.json file.<br>
This helps maintain a consistent and reproducible development environment for your project.</p>

How to use ESLINT -->> basics <<------------

********************************************
1. Create or Lint Your JavaScript Files:
********************************************
Now, you can use ESLint to lint your JavaScript files.

For example, to lint a specific file, run:
````````````````````````
npx eslint your-file.js
````````````````````````
Or, to lint all JavaScript files in a directory:
`````````````````````
npx eslint .
`````````````````````
ESLint will provide feedback on any issues or errors it finds in your code based on the rules you've configured.

***********************************************
2. Fixing Issues:
***********************************************
To automatically fix some of the ESLint errors, you can run:
````````````````````````````````````````
npx eslint --fix your-file.js
````````````````````````````````````````
This command will attempt to automatically fix some of the issues according to your ESLint configuration.
